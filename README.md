# NLPic Book Summarizer

## Overview
This project involves the analysis and understanding of a dataset of book summaries using NLP, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization techniques. 

For the Computer Vision component, due to limitations in Google Colab, 1024 random text summaries have been selected and their images have been generated.

## Objective
Create a Python script or notebook that combines the mentioned technologies to perform the following tasks:
- Data Preprocessing and EDA
- NLP Component
- Computer Vision Component

## Requirements
1. **Data Preprocessing and EDA:**
   - Clean the data by handling missing values.
   - Explore the dataset to understand its characteristics.

2. **NLP Component:**
   - Condense the book summaries to make them shorter.

3. **Computer Vision Component:**
   - Convert the condensed text summaries into images using a Text-to-Image model.
